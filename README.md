## Getting Started

# Cassidy Bot Tutorial

Welcome to the Cassidy Bot tutorial! üéâ This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Cassidy bot on Railway. Cassidy is a bot that connects with Facebook Messenger (and optionally Discord) to automate your interactions. Follow these steps to get it up and running smoothly! üòé

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A GitHub account üìÇ
- A Facebook Page (create one if you don‚Äôt have it yet) üìò
- A dummy Facebook account (don‚Äôt use your main account!) ü§ñ
- A browser with extension support (e.g., Kiwi Browser) üåê
- The "Cookie Editor" extension installed üõ†Ô∏è
- A Railway account ([sign up here](https://railway.app)) üöÇ

---

## Step 1: Fork the Main Repository üç¥

Get your own copy of the Cassidy bot code by forking the main repository or generating from it's template.

1. Visit the main repo: [https://github.com/lianecagara/CassidySpectra](https://github.com/lianecagara/CassidySpectra).
2. Click the **"Fork"** or **Use Template** button in the top-right corner. (we suggest to use template to get the ability to make your repository private (nobody else sees!))
3. Select your GitHub account to create your forked/generated repo.

Your forked/generated repository will be at `https://github.com/your-username/CassidySpectra`. ‚úÖ

---

## Step 2: Set Up a Dummy Facebook Account & Get Cookies üç™

You‚Äôll need a dummy Facebook account to run the bot safely.

1. Create a new dummy Facebook account (not your main one!).
2. Open the account in a browser with extension support (e.g., Kiwi Browser, Microsoft Edge, Chrome (PC)).
3. Install the **"Cookie Editor"** or best, **"C3C FBState"** extension from the Chrome Web Store.
4. Click the Cookie Editor icon and export the cookies in **JSON format**.
5. Setup a programming environment (ex. Visual Studio Code, Replit)
6. Clone your previously generated repository, example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CassidySpectra
cd CassidySpectra
```
7. In your forked repo, find the `cookie.json` file.
8. Replace its contents with your exported JSON cookies.
9. (Optional) run this bash command: (only if you have an .env file)
```bash
node hidestate
```
This command will hide your appstate or cookie.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Don‚Äôt commit sensitive info like cookies to a public repo! If your fork is public, make it private or use environment variables instead. (Also don't ever push .env to your repo)

---

## Step 3: (Optional) Set Up Discord Integration üéÆ

Want Cassidy to work with Discord too? This step is optional!

1. Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application or pick an existing one.
3. Go to the **"Bot"** section and create a bot.
4. Copy the bot token.
5. Add the token to the right file in your forked repo (e.g., `settings.json`‚Äîcheck the repo docs for details).
```json
{
 // other infos...
  "discordBotToken": "",
  "discordClientID": "",
}
```

**Note:** This is optional and might depend on the bot‚Äôs setup. Skip if you‚Äôre only using Facebook Messenger.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Facebook Messenger Integration üì©

To make Cassidy work with Facebook Messenger, you‚Äôll need to configure it via Facebook Developers.

### Prerequisites
- A Facebook Page (create one if you don‚Äôt have it).

### Steps
1. **Go to Facebook Developers:**
   - Visit [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com).

2. **Create a Developer Account (if needed):**
   - Log in with your Facebook account and set up a developer profile.

3. **Create an App:**
   - Click **"My Apps"** > **"Create App"**.
   - Select **"Business"** as the app type.
   - Enter the app name and email, then hit **"Create App ID"**.

4. **Add Messenger Product:**
   - In the sidebar, click **"Add Product"**.
   - Find **"Messenger"** and click **"Set Up"**.

5. **Connect Your Facebook Page:**
   - Scroll to **"Access Tokens"**.
   - Click **"Add or Remove Pages"** and link your page.
   - Generate a **Page Access Token** by clicking **"Generate Token"**. Copy it!

6. **Set Up Webhooks:**
   - Go to **"Webhooks"** in Messenger settings.
   - Click **"Setup Webhooks"**.
   - Fill in:
     - **Callback URL:** `https://your_hosting.site/webhook` (update this later after deployment).
     - **Verify Token:** `(make your own verify token in the developer.facebook.com example: pagebot you put in the developer.facebook.com verify token pagebot and get the verify token once again and put it in the settings.json)`
     - Warn: Never leak verify token.
   - Subscribe to:
     - `messages`
     - `messaging_optins`
     - `messaging_postbacks`
   - Click **"Verify and Save"**.

   **Note:** You‚Äôll update the Callback URL after deploying on Railway.

7. **Add Page Subscriptions:**
   - In **"Page Subscriptions"**, select your connected page.
   - Ensure `messages`, `messaging_optins`, and `messaging_postbacks` are checked.

8. **Get Your Page Access Token:**
   - Back in **"Access Tokens"**, copy the Page Access Token.

9. **Add Token to Bot:**
   - In your forked repo, open `settings.json`.
   - Paste the Page Access Token there.
```json
{
 // other infos...
  "pageAccessToken": "",
  "pageVerifyToken": "",
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Don‚Äôt commit tokens to a public repo! Use environment variables if possible.

---

## Step 5: Configure the Bot ‚öôÔ∏è

Double-check these files in your forked repo:
- `cookie.json`: Has your dummy account‚Äôs cookies.
- `settings.json`: Has your Page Access Token.
- (Optional) Discord token file, if you set up Discord.

---

## Step 6: Deploy on Railway üöÇ

Time to get Cassidy live using Railway and Docker!

### Prerequisites
- A Railway account ([railway.app](https://railway.app)).
- Docker installed locally (optional, for testing).

### Steps
1. **Check the Dockerfile:**
   - Your forked repo should have a Dockerfile set for **Node.js 23.7.0 or higher**.  
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Lower versions will cause errors!

2. **Create a Railway Project:**
   - Log in to Railway.
   - Click **"New Project"** > **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**.
   - Pick your forked Cassidy-Spectra repo.

3. **Set Up Deployment:**
   - Railway will use the Dockerfile automatically.
   - Set the server region to **USA Oregon** (no other regions allowed!).

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** USA Oregon is required for proper operation.

4. **Setup Environment Variables**
   - Add your MONGO_URI and APPSTATE there. 

4. **Deploy the Bot:**
   - Hit **"Deploy"** and wait for it to finish.
   - Railway will give you a URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`).

5. **Update Webhook URL:**
   - Return to Facebook Developer settings.
   - In **"Webhooks"**, update the Callback URL to your Railway URL + `/webhook` (e.g., `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app/webhook`).
   - Verify and save.

---

## Bonus Step: For Persistent Database
1. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
MONGO_URI="replace with the mongodb uri"
```

### Deployment

1. To deploy the bot, simply run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 7: Test Your Messenger Bot üß™

Let‚Äôs make sure it works!

1. **Open Your Facebook Page:**
   - Go to the page you connected.

2. **Send a Test Message:**
   - Use a different account (not the dummy one) to message the page.
   - Try sending **"help"** to see available commands.

**Note:** The bot only responds to accounts with specific roles in the app. Add roles next!

---

## Adding Roles üë§

To let certain accounts interact with the bot, assign roles in your Facebook app.

1. **Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com):**
   - Log in to your developer account.

2. **Access Your App:**
   - Find your app in **"My Apps"**.

3. **Select "App Roles":**
   - Look for **"App Roles"** or **"Roles and Permissions"**.

4. **Add Roles:**
   - Click **"Add Role"** and define the role name/permissions.

5. **Assign Roles to Users:**
   - Assign the role to the accounts you want to use with the bot (provide their name or ID).

**Note:** Ensure your test account has a role assigned to get responses!

---

## Final Notes üìù

- Keep cookies and tokens secure‚Äîdon‚Äôt expose them in a public repo! üîí
- Check Railway logs if you run into issues. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- For more features, peek at the repo‚Äôs documentation. üìö

Congrats! Your Cassidy bot is now running on Railway. Enjoy automating your Messenger tasks! üéâ
 


## Creating Commands
